# About

Phonebook is a Java Application that maps friends' names to their respective phone numbers given an unknown number of entries of names and numbers. You can query names in the phonebook. If a name is found, there will be an output in the following format: name=phoneNumber. If a name is not found, "Not Found" will be the output. 

# Installation
 - Make sure you have Java installed on your computer.
 - Download or Clone the git repository. 
 - Navigate to the directory where you downloaded/cloned the repository using your terminal.
 - Run 'javac Contact.java'
 - Run 'java Contact'
 
# How To Use The Application
  - Enter the number of entries you want to enter into the phonebook. The number can be anything between 1 and 100,000.
  - Enter the name and number into your phonebook. Use the first name and an 8 digit number as your format with a space in between them e.g. Kanye 12345678. The number of entries should be the one you specified i.e. If you entered 10 as the number of entries, you should enter 10 names and numbers.
  - After finishing the step above, you can now search the phonebook for contacts in it using only the name. If a name is found, it will be printed along with its number. If not, "Not Found" will be printed instead.
